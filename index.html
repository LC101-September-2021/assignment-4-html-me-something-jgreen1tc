      <h2>Community-driven MUD running The Burning Wheel</h2>
      <p>Catalyst is planned to be an automated GM app for The Burning Wheel tabletop roleplaying system. It allows users to host/join games of The Burning Wheel, allowing them easy access to their important game assets, while handling the complicated rules interpretations for them. It relies on community creation and input to generate the narrative content of the campaign. Follow the projects progress on <a href="https://github.com/jgreen1tc/Catalyst.git">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <h2>Planned features/vision</h2>
      <p>The full feature-set of the project will ultimately be based upon the <a href="images/Burning-Wheel-Procedural-Guide-2.2.pdf">Burning Wheel Procedural Guide</a>. A strong benefit of Burning Wheel is that while complicated, the rules tightly guide the experience in a player character focused way. I believe this is a great opportunity for software to manage the complexity of a task but keep the user in control of which task it handles. Gameplay should be intuitive so that the users can focus on the story they create with the assurance that they are playing the system both correctly and optimally.</p>

      <h2>Initial task: Character sheet</h2>
      <p>Although there are many more features planned, the most natural place to start was getting an automated character sheet working. The first thing I made was the basic die rolling and the building blocks for each character element as a javascript class. See the below images for the base information needed for each character sheet:</p>

      </div>

      <h2>More About Burning Wheel</h2>
      <p>The Burning Wheel is a tabletop roleplaying game, similar to D&amp;D, with an emphasis on character progression linked to characters fighting for their beliefs, not just slaying monsters.
