      <p>My passion and affinity for technology,  started at a young age. The early Internet days were magical to me as a kid. Little did I know that the skills I was developing while tinkering with our family computer and crawling the web for information on how it all WORKED would be developing my independent research skills and a lifelong obsession with technology</p>

      <p>My first formal introduction to computer science was Introduction to Computer Science (as well as Computer Maintenance) in high school. By then, I definitely considered myself more of a power-user than most kids my age, but it was all literally a foreign language to me. While interesting, I decided that I'd remain an enthusiast, and to make it in the tech industry, you had to have the right combination of gifted ability and luck to get noticed. Some of the things I learned about stuck with me, namely the Linux operating system.</p>

      <p>Ater learning about Linux and becoming infatuated with open-source ideology, I researched different pros and cons of switching and different distros for at least a year or two before I finally decided to settle on Arch Linux btw. The first few moments after formatting my hard drive on my laptop and realizing there was no going back were nerve wracking. I had went to the library and printed out the entire installation document to follow along with. Getting my system fully customized from the command line up was a very proud moment for me, and being responsible for maintaining a rolling release distro that I was constantly tweaking, breaking, and fixing definitely led to some character-building moments during my university years, especially during finals times. But tinkering with tech was still just a hobby for me.</p>

      <p>Since then though, I have had more of a taste in following my passion. I have also always been very active and have been a competitive long distance runner since I was a kid as well. But again I was too filled with self doubt that the fitness industry didn't need me and that I couldn't make it a career. That all changed one day when my best friend from college recommended I come work with him in a gym. This spurred me to working everything to sales, to personal trainer, to assistant GM to even the General Manager of a gym. And even though the circumstances about location and pay (and coincidentally, the pandemic) cause me to switch out of the industry, I knew that I was done ignoring my passion.</p>

      <p>I got a job to hold me over, but I also immediately started looking into learning to code online. I had heard of freecodecamp.org a while back, so I started there. HTML and CSS seemed familiar since I dabbled with MySpace during its day, but I stopped the javascript portion part of the way through. I had also been consuming udemy courses for vim, git, python, web design, wordpress, figma, webflow, AWS... I actually found that I sometimes spent more time gathering resources and researching WHAT to learn more than I was actually learning to code. And the lack of structure, support, and PLAN had me spinning my wheels in beginner tutorial hell for about a year. Which brings me to LaunchCode.</p>

      <p>I can't remember how I originally found out about LaunchCode, but it was a while ago and I had written it off like I had written off so many things before. But after having a few unrelated people mention it to me, I took the plunge. And here I am - in the midst of my passion. I've never felt so confident and interested in what I'm learning, and having the structure and support from everyone in the program makes the future seem more bright and realistic.</p>
