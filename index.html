      <h1>The Catalyst</h1>
      <h2>Community-driven MUD running The Burning Wheel</h2>
      <p>The Catalyst is planned to be an automated GM app for The Burning Wheel tabletop roleplaying system. It allows users to host/join games of The Burning Wheel, allowing them easy access to their important game assets, while handling the complicated rules interpretations for them. It relies on community creation and input to generate the narrative content of the campaign.</p>

      <h2>Planned features</h2>
      <ul>
         <p>Users should be able to login and create:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Games</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>with the mechanics of GM/Player turns to be tracked</li>
               </ul>
            <li>Characters</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>with the ability for character rolls and progression to be tracked</li>
               </ul>
         </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>Initial task: Character sheet</h2>
      <p>Although there are many more features planned, the most natural place to start was getting an automated character sheet working. The first thing I made was the basic die rolling and the building blocks for each character element as a javascript class. See the below images for the base information needed for each character sheet:</p>
